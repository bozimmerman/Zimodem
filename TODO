Bugs Reported (nor reproduced):
 *. Test high speed X-modem transfers between two gurumodem hosts. 
 
New Features:
  *. Support switching between CONNECT #ID and CONNECT 1200 messages?
  *. Add gopher client, or at least at&g type gopher command (gopher://?)
  *. Ability to use protocols for at&g, and maybe have alternative at+web
  *. SSL/SSH server sockets? 
  *. Ability to ftp file streamdown, like at&g.. maybe at+ftp
  *. SHELL wget command.
  *. LYNX-like browser?
  *. Baud rate test command (what good is this? how do you send cmd if baud is wrong?!)
  *. ATW0 should be same as ATW
  *. SLIP support?
  *. PPP support?

New hardware hopes:
 C+B 0 FLAG2+PB0	RxD	Receive Data (Must be applied to both pins!)
 D!  1 RTS	Ready To Send
 F!  3 RI	Ring Indicator (1650 ring indicator - output of modem -> input of computer )
 H!	4 DCD	Data Carrier Detect
 J!   5 1650 Pulse Dial Pin (output of computer -> input to modem)
 +K	6 CTS	Clear To Send
 M!	8 TxD	Transmit Data
